#### _By Maggie Harrington_
##### _4-7-17_


## Description

##### An Angular CLI application written in TypeScript that allows the user to manage the member list of a hiking club. The user can:
* visit a page to see a list of all club members
* click a club member's entry in the list to visit their profile page, which includes more details about them
* visit an "About" page that explains what the club is, and what they do
* filter the list of users by their particular role in the group, or some other information/category
* add new users to the club, edit existing user profiles, or delete users (all data is persisted in a database)


##### This project demonstrates the following skills:
* Use of components to create display and behavior for templates
* Use of a router to navigate between pages
* Use of dynamic routing
* Use of a service to share data between multiple components
* Use of a model to organize data
* Filtering models through a pipe
* Use of Firebase to retrieve data displayed in the application
* Ability to create, edit, and delete instances of a model, persisting all changes in Firebase
* Use of two-way data binding in an edit/update form
* Use of TypeScript with defined data types
